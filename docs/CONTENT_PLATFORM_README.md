## 🔧 GOAT Operating Model — Plain Statement

GOAT is **not software-as-a-service** and does **not** operate on subscriptions.

GOAT provides **one-time, per-project content preparation services**.
Each order is a discrete job with a defined output. You pay once, GOAT delivers files, and the transaction ends.

There are:

* No subscriptions
* No recurring fees
* No usage plans
* No credits
* No renewals
* No lock-in

GOAT does **not** host, publish, distribute, or retain rights to your content.

### What GOAT Does

GOAT prepares content so it is **professionally structured, technically correct, and ready for the next step** (printing, recording, narration, or platform upload).

GOAT focuses on:

* Organization
* Structure
* Formatting
* Technical preparation
* Compliance readiness

GOAT delivers **finished files**, not access to tools.

### What GOAT Does Not Do

GOAT does **not**:

* Act as a publishing platform
* Provide ongoing access or accounts beyond order tracking
* Charge monthly or recurring fees
* Sell subscriptions or memberships
* Retain ownership of customer content
* Require continued payment to use delivered files

Once files are delivered, they are **yours to use anywhere, forever**.

### Payment Model (Explicit)

* Pricing is **per product, per order**
* Payment is **required before processing**
* Each pass adds **specific, defined work**
* No payment implies no processing
* No future charges occur after delivery

There is no concept of "canceling" because nothing renews.

### Positioning (Why This Exists)

Traditional content preparation is expensive because it charges for **human time, overhead, and coordination**, not just outcomes.

GOAT replaces that overhead with automation and structured workflows, allowing professional preparation at a fraction of traditional cost.

GOAT does **not** compete with agencies or studios.
GOAT removes the cost barrier to *getting ready*.

### One-Sentence Summary (Use Anywhere)

> GOAT is a one-time, pay-per-project content preparation service — not a subscription, not a platform, and not a publisher.
