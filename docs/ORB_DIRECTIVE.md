## **Orb Scope & Identity Directive**

* The **Cali Caleon Orb** belongs to **UCM_4_Core — CALI** in **admin/operator contexts**.
* GOAT and DALS **implement their own native orbs** aligned to the same presence principles.
* The Orb is **not page-scoped** and must persist across navigation within its system.
* In **user contexts**, the Orb is hidden by default and appears **only after explicit escalation opt-in**.

### Identity Boundaries

* **UCM_4_Core — CALI** → Cali Caleon Orb
* **Cali X One** → native orb
* **KayGee 1.0** → native orb

Orb implementations are **identity-bound** and **not shared UI components**.

### Language & Behavior

* No "Guardian" language.
* No implied authority, monitoring, or recommendations.
* GOAT and DALS expose **tools and status only**; they do not speak as Cali.

### Enforcement

* UI strings must come from shared constants.
* Naming drift is a bug.
