# **SECTION 1 — The Problem**

## **Most people die twice.**

Once when their heart stops…
And again when their knowledge disappears.

Your wisdom, your stories, your perspective — all of it fades when you're gone.

Cloud platforms won't save it.
Social media buries it.
AI companies steal it.

Your legacy deserves better.

# **SECTION 2 — The GOAT Solution**

## **Your Life. Digitized. Immortalized. Owned by YOU.**

# **SECTION 5.5 — GOAT Content Makers: Professional Publishing Prep**

## **The Hidden Cost of "Getting to Print-Ready"**

You're absolutely right to push on this. The gap between **"just printing"** and **"getting to print-ready"** is massive — prep work can be 50–100× the print cost.

### What Professionals Actually Charge (2025–2026)

**Hourly rates for graphic design:**
- **Low end:** $15–$40/hour
- **Mid range:** $50–$100/hour
- **High end / senior / agency:** $100–$150+/hour

**Typical booklet/brochure projects:**
- Simple flyer: **$50–$200**
- Multi-page brochure/catalog: **hundreds to several thousand**

### The Real Cost Components Before "Print"

1. **Content prep / structuring:** $200–$1,000+
2. **Layout & design:** $500–$6,000+ (10–40 billable hours)
3. **Typography & visual system:** Hundreds to thousands in value
4. **Print-prep and production:** $100–$500+

**Industry reality:** Basic multi-page print piece = **$800–$1,800** total. Professional level = **$1,800–$4,800**. Premium/agency = **$4,800–$12,000+**.

### Printing Itself Is Cheap
- Small-run booklets: Tens to hundreds of dollars
- **Prep cost > 10×–50× print cost**
- For short runs (25–50 copies): **Prep is 50–100× the marginal print cost**

**Core truth:** "Just getting to the point where you can safely hit 'Print' costs an order of magnitude more than the printing itself."

## **GOAT Content Makers: Prep Without the Pain**

### 📖 **Booklet Maker** — $9–$35
Turn any content into print-ready booklets. Professional design, layout, typography, and print optimization.

**Traditional cost:** $800–$12,000+  
**GOAT cost:** $35 for complete print-ready booklet  
**Savings:** 95–99%

### 🎙️ **Podcast Maker** — $55–$125
Create professional podcast episodes from scripts or audio. Full production, metadata, and distribution-ready files.

**Traditional cost:** $300–$5,800+ per episode  
**GOAT cost:** $125 for broadcast-ready episode  
**Savings:** 45–97%

### 🎧 **Audiobook Maker** — $60–$130
Transform manuscripts into ACX-ready audiobooks with watermarked previews.

**Traditional cost:** $8,500–$90,000+  
**GOAT cost:** $257 for complete professional audiobook  
**Savings:** 97–99%

### **GOAT Positioning**
"We're not claiming to be a full-service design agency replacement. We're saying: **We prepare your content so printing/publishing is easy and correct, without charging you agency prices.**"

**You can confidently say:**
- "Traditional booklet prep often costs **hundreds to thousands** just to get a print-ready file."
- "Professional design work for multi-page print pieces routinely starts around **$800 and climbs into the thousands**."
- "Most of that cost is *thinking and prep*, not the printing itself — GOAT targets that specific pain point at a tiny fraction of the price."
