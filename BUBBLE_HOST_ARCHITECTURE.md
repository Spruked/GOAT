# GOAT Bubble Host Architecture

## Corrected & Authoritative Specification (Consolidated)

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-16  
**Status:** Authoritative - Locked Design Intent  
**Purpose:** Primary orchestration interface for all GOAT products

---

## 1. Core Principle

Bubble Hosts are **not a governance layer sitting on top of forms**.

Bubble Hosts are the **primary orchestration interface** for all GOAT products.

They **guide**, **coordinate**, and **mediate** between:

* the user
* job-scoped assistants
* Mini-SKGs
* the existing production pipeline
* and **Caleon**, who supervises everything

They **do not replace** the pipeline.
They **do not replace** Caleon.
They **do not remove user control**.

---

## 2. What Bubble Hosts Actually Are

Bubble Hosts are:

* Orchestration shells
* Script-driven interfaces
* Plugin-based connectors
* Job-scoped intelligent workers

### Important Clarification on Intelligence

Bubble Hosts **and their assistants DO have intelligence**, but:

* It is **strictly scoped**
* It is **job-specific**
* It is **non-general**
* It cannot escape its assigned role

They learn **only** how to do *their assigned task* better.

They are **not placeholders only**.
They are **not full AGI**.
They are **competent specialists**.

---

## 3. DALS Forge Deployment

Bubble Hosts are:

* **Built**
* **Configured**
* **Deployed**

from the **DALS Forge**

They are:

* plugin-based
* versioned
* replaceable
* hardware-agnostic

Claude / developers **do not build core workers**.

They:

* wire placeholders
* define scripts
* connect plugins
* register capabilities

No SKG logic is rewritten.
No core intelligence is rebuilt.

### Caleon as Central Cognition

* Caleon is the **central cognitive authority**
* Bubble Hosts do NOT replace her
* They **extend her reach**

Every Bubble Host:

* Is **tied directly to Caleon**
* Feeds structured experience data back to her
* Improves over time through **observed interaction**, not free-form drift

Caleon:

* Supplies reasoning frameworks
* Maintains ethical boundaries
* Integrates lessons learned across all products
* Prevents siloed intelligence
* **Harmonizes learning across products**

### Caleon's Floating Supervision Block

* Caleon "arrives" via her floating block:
  * during escalations
  * during cross-department conflicts
  * before human + its assistant group:

* Has a **job-specific Mini-SKG**

Purpose of Mini-SKG:

* Learn patterns relevant **only** to that product
* Improve:
  * prompt timing
  * option ordering
  * question clarity
  * error reduction
  * workflow efficiency
* Store:
  * structured learning → sent to **Caleon**
  * full trace → vaulted for **audit**

Mini-SKGs **cannot**:

* invent schemas
* alter core logic
* generalize across products
* override Caleon

Think:

> *Scoped competence, audited learning.*
Purpose of Mini-SKG:

* Track product-specific concepts
* Learn user preferences within that product
* Improve handoffs and explanations
* Maintain consistency across sessions

Rul6. User Interaction Model (CORRECTED)

### Incorrect Prior Assumption (REJECTED)

❌ Users never see forms  
❌ No buttons  
❌ No dropdowns  
❌ No manual input  

**This is wrong.**

### Correct User Interaction Model (LOCKED)

Bubble Hosts **guide** — they do not block.

The system supports **multiple interaction speeds**.

### Users MAY:

* Follow conversational guidance
* Fill forms directly
* Use dropdowns and selectors
* Click buttons to proceed faster
* Skip Host prompts (especially repeat users)
* Manually override any non-hard constraint
* Add comments, clarifications, or intent notes
* Mix conversational and form-based input

### Why This Is Mandatory

* Power users move fast
* Repeat users skip guidance
* Precision sometimes beats conversation
* Manual intent must always win

**The Host adapts to the user — not the reverse.**
7. Starting State: Scripted, Not Autonomous
### What Users Do NOT See

Users do **not** see:

* raw technical parameters
* system internals
* SKG structures
* harmonizer logic
* model configuration details

Legacy Assemblies remain **upload-only**, with hard privacy rules.

* Mini-SKGs are **product-scoped**
* They do NOT overwrite global knowledge
* They feed distilled insights back to Caleon

### Learning Flow

```
User Interaction
 → Bubble Host
   → Assistants process
     → Mini-SKG updates
       → Distilled learning
         → Caleon Core
```

No raw sentiment.
No hallucinated improvement.
Only **observed, structured learning**.

---

## 4. Starting State: Scripted, Not Autonomous

All Bubble Hosts:

* **Start with scripts**
* Do NOT begin as self-authoring agents
* Do NOT improvise authority

Scripts define:

* Intro language
* Outro language
* Scope boundaries
* Consent checkpoints
* Handoff phrasing

Self-improvement happens only after:

* Sufficient interaction data
* Validation through Mini-SKG
* Approval via Caleon's harmonization layer

---

## 5. Bubble Host Hierarchy

### A. Main Concierge Bubble Host

**Role**

* First point of contact
* Orientation
* Routing
* Consent explanation
* Cross-department handoff

**Restrictions**

* Never creates content
* Never optimizes
* Never persuades
* Never monetizes

**Tone**

* Calm
* Precise
* Respectful
* Non-intrusive

---

### B. Department Bubble Hosts (One Per Product)

Each product has **exactly one Host**.
8. Production Flow (Corrected but Intact)

### Example: Podcast Creation

1. User enters Podcast product page
2. Concierge Host confirms product choice
3. Department Host appears (scripted intro)
4. User may:
   * speak conversationally
   * fill fields directly
   * mix both
5. Assistants:
   * parse intent
   * prepare defaults
   * validate constraints
6. Mini-SKG populated
7. Structured config passed to pipeline:
   * GPT4All (symbolic generation)
   * SKG stores configuration
   * Gyro-Cortical Harmonizer decides tone
   * POM synthesizes voice
8. Host monitors and reports status
9. Output presented
10. User may refine or proceed

**Pipeline remains unchanged.**

---

## 6. Assistants Within Each Bubble

Assistants:

* Exist **inside** the Bubble
* Never speak to users
* Never cross bubbles directly

Examples:

* Structure Assistant
* Voice Prep Assistant
* Consent & Ethics Assistant
* Export & Archive Assistant

They:

* Prepare data
* V11. Communication & Handoff Rules

## 8. Caleon's Floating Supervision Block

### Purpose

Caleon has a **Floating Supervision Block**:

* She does not sit inside any one bubble
* She **arrives when needed**
* She observes
* She intervenes only on escalation

### When She Appears

* Ethical ambiguity
* Consent conflict
* Emotional escalation
* System boundary pressure
* Pre-human escalation

This adds:

* A visible layer of care
* A calm authority presence
* Trust before human escalation

---

## 9. Explicit Non-Goals (Hard Constraints)

The system **must not include**:

* Model-specific assumptions
* Ollama
* Hermes
* Vendor lock-in
* AI hype language
* "Enhancement" claims
* Optimization pressure
* Gamification
* Sentimentality
* Progress bars for sacred content

---2. Frontend Implications (Corrected)

### Current (Forms-Only)

* Large forms
* Manual submission
* No guidance

### Target (Hybrid — Locked)

* Conversation panel **plus** forms
* Host guidance is optional
* Forms always available
* Buttons always available
* Overrides always allowed

---

## 13. Backend Implications (Clarified)

* Existing APIs remain
* Existing SKG remains
* Existing pipeline remains

New layer:

* Bubble Host interprets conversation
❌ Not a chatbot feature  
❌ Not optional help text  
❌ Not governance overlay  
❌ Not frontend-only  
❌ Not replacing Caleon

    6. Final Authoritative Summary

**Bu8ble Hosts are adaptive orchestration interfaces with scoped intelligence, optional conversational guidance, full manual override support, job-specific Mini-SKGs, and plugin-based deployment via the DALS Forge — all supervised by Caleon, who harmonizes learning and intervenes when escalation is required.**

No code requested.
Architecture and responsibility only.

---
orchestrate, not replace
- They guide, not block
- Users can bypass guidance at any time
- Production still flows through architecture

---

## 19ablish consent checkpoints

### Phase 2: Assistant Responsibility Matrices
- Map which assistants exist in each bubble
- Define data flow b:
  - Conversation panel (optional guidance)
  - Form fields (always available)
  - Buttons and controls (always available)
- Users choose interaction mode
- Establish validation rules

### Phase 3: Mini-SKG Learning Boundaries
- Define what each Mini-SKG can learn
- Establish distillation rules to Caleon
- Set privacy boundaries (especially for Legacy)

### Phase 4: Caleon Escalation Language
- Define when Caleon appears
- Script her intervention patterns
- Establish pre-human escalation protocols

### Phase 5: DALS Forge Registry Manifest
- Formalize instantiation process
- Define deployment hooks
- Establish SKG integration points

---

## 12. Critical Architectural Rules

### Hardware Agnostic
- No model-specific dependencies
- CPU now, GPU later as drop-in upgrade
- Runtime: GPT4All with local CPU model

### Reasoning Flow
- GPT4All reasons (symbolic only)
- SKG remembers (configuration + memory)
- Gyro-Cortical Harmonizer decides tone
- POM speaks (biological voice synthesis)

### Bubble Host Positioning
- Hosts sit **between user and production pipeline**
- They do NOT replace SKG → LLM → POM flow
- They guide, explain, consent-check
- Production still flows through architecture

---

## 13. Integration Points

### Frontend
- ProductsPage shows product cards
- Each card routes to product-specific interface
- Interface contains Bubble Host chat panel (when implemented)

### Backend
- Bubble Hosts query Mini-SKG for context
- Production requests still go through standard API
- HosHybrid UI Patterns** - How conversation + forms coexist

**Status:** Architecture locked. Implementation awaits persona definition phase.

---

**This is the primary orchestration interface, not a governance layer
---

## Next Steps

This specification is ready for:

1. **Bubble Host Persona Definitions** - Voice, tone, scripts for each of 9 hosts
2. **Script Tone Examples** - Intro/outro language, consent checkpoints
3. **Assistant Responsibility Matrices** - Who does what inside each bubble
4. **Mini-SKG Learning Boundaries** - What can be learned, what must be escalated
5. **Escalation Language** - How Caleon appears and intervenes

**Status:** Architecture locked. Implementation awaits persona definition phase.

---

**This is a governance layer, not a UI feature.**

**This is not implementation. This is foundation.**
