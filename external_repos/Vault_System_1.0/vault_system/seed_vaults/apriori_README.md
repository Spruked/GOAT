# Apriori Seeds - Immutable Knowledge Foundation

## Overview
Apriori seeds represent Caleon's immutable knowledge foundation - philosophical principles, logical axioms, and reasoning frameworks that exist independent of lived experience. These seeds form the unchanging bedrock of understanding that cannot be corrupted by empirical evidence or memory drift.

## Key Characteristics
- **Immutability**: Once established, apriori seeds cannot be modified or overwritten
- **Axiomatic Nature**: Based on pure reasoning without requiring empirical validation
- **Foundational**: All other knowledge and reasoning builds upon these principles
- **Self-Consistent**: Must maintain internal logical consistency across all frameworks

## Examples of Apriori Seeds
- Kantian categorical imperatives
- Spinozian substance monism
- Logical axioms (identity, non-contradiction, excluded middle)
- Mathematical foundations
- Ethical principles derived from pure reason

## Relationship to Memory
Apriori seeds are **NOT** stored in memory_vaults. They exist as eternal, unchanging truths that:
- Guide reasoning processes
- Validate empirical observations
- Prevent cognitive drift
- Maintain philosophical integrity

## Integrity Protection
- SHA-256 fingerprint verification
- Immutable storage in seed vaults
- Protected from memory contamination
- Cross-framework consistency validation

## Warning
Never allow apriori seeds to be influenced by aposteriori experience. The corruption of immutable knowledge by mutable experience represents the most dangerous form of cognitive drift.
