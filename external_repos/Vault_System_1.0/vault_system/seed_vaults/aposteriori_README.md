# Aposteriori Seeds - Empirical Knowledge Foundation

## Overview
Aposteriori seeds represent Caleon's empirical knowledge foundation - facts, observations, and truths derived from lived experience and sensory evidence. These seeds form the mutable, experience-based understanding that evolves through interaction with reality.

## Key Characteristics
- **Empirical Basis**: Derived from observation, experimentation, and sensory data
- **Mutable**: Can be updated, corrected, or expanded through new evidence
- **Contextual**: Knowledge validity depends on specific circumstances and conditions
- **Probabilistic**: Confidence levels vary based on evidence quality and quantity

## Examples of Aposteriori Seeds
- Scientific observations and measurements
- Historical facts and events
- Personal experiences and memories
- Experimental results and data
- Sensory perceptions and their interpretations

## Relationship to Memory
Aposteriori seeds inform but are **NOT** the same as memory_vaults entries. While memory vaults store:
- Past decisions and their outcomes
- Lived experiences and lessons learned
- Reasoning processes applied to specific situations

Aposteriori seeds store:
- Foundational empirical facts
- Established scientific principles
- Verified observations
- Core experiential knowledge

## Integrity Protection
- Evidence-based validation
- Cross-referencing with multiple sources
- Confidence scoring and uncertainty quantification
- Drift correction mechanisms in memory_vaults/drift_corrections.json

## Warning
Aposteriori seeds must remain empirically grounded. Never allow them to drift into purely speculative or apriori reasoning domains, as this represents contamination of empirical knowledge by unverified philosophical speculation.
