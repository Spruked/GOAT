<br>
For my daughter Abigail - may these words carry my love to you always.
<br>
The Jury of Literary Greats 
Every father has a story to tell, but mine is one that demands 
evidence, testimony, and judgment. It’s a story of mistakes 
and redemption, of sorrow and joy, and above all, of love—a 
love so steadfast that it called for a jury of unparalleled insight 
to evaluate it. 
This jury is no ordinary assembly; it is a tribunal of the finest 
literary minds. Each of these towering figures was chosen 
with care, not to weigh my shortcomings, but to deliberate on 
the singular truth of my devotion to my daughter, Abby. 
Why them? Because each juror brings something unique to 
the courtroom of my heart: 
• 
Jane Austen, with her wit and wisdom, understands 
the delicate balance of duty and affection. 
• 
Emily Dickinson, whose introspection sees beyond 
what is spoken, into the quiet depths of a father’s 
soul. 
• 
Mark Twain, ever the skeptic, demands plain truth 
wrapped in a touch of humor. 
• 
Leo Tolstoy, who knows the weight of human frailty 
and the strength of redemption. 
• 
Sylvia Plath, who feels the ache of longing and the 
spark of hope in every line. 
Happy Toes 
4 
• 
Walt Whitman, who embraces the raw, untamed 
spirit of life and love in all its forms. 
And so it goes, each juror selected for the quality they 
embody—a quality that reflects not just their writing, but a 
facet of my love for Abby. Their voices, diverse and 
profound, take the simple words of a father’s poem and 
reimagine them, rendering a verdict beyond doubt or debate. 
The result of their deliberation is unanimous: I stand 
convicted of loving Abby with all my heart, beyond any 
shadow of doubt. 
This book is both their testimony and my evidence. It is a 
collaboration across time and spirit, brought together by a 
father’s unyielding hope that his words will reach his daughter 
in ways life sometimes does not allow. 
Abby, this is my love letter to you, written not just in my 
hand but carried by voices far greater than mine. These pages 
hold the truth of how I feel, no matter the past, no matter the 
distance. It is a truth I hope you carry with you always: I love 
you. 
And to you, dear reader, I ask only this: hear the testimony, 
read the evidence, and deliver your own verdict.

Table of Contents</div><div id="introduction" class="chapter"><h2>Introduction</h2>Happy Toes began as a deeply personal expression of love, 
written during a time of profound uncertainty and reflection. 
This poem was born out of the unyielding love of a father for 
his daughter, Abigail. Written while I was incarcerated, the 
poem became a vessel for all the thoughts, dreams, and hopes 
I might never have had the chance to share with her in 
person. In those moments, I poured my heart into words, 
trying to capture the beauty, innocence, and boundless 
potential I saw in my daughter, even from afar. 
The title, Happy Toes, symbolizes the small yet magical 
moments that define a child’s life—the joy of discovery, the 
simplicity of play, and the unspoken connection between a 
parent and their child. It is about cherishing the fleeting 
moments of childhood and reminding Abby that she is loved 
unconditionally. Every line of the poem is a testament to the 
unbreakable bond we share, even when life’s circumstances 
have challenged us. 
This book is more than just my original poem. It is a 
collaborative reimagining of Happy Toes through the lenses 
of some of history’s greatest literary minds. From the satirical 
wit of Mark Twain to the lyrical depth of Maya Angelou, each 
author has breathed new life into the poem, transforming it 
into a unique reflection of their style. These reimagining’s are 
not merely exercises in literary homage; they are a celebration 
of creativity and an enduring gift to my daughter—a 
Happy Toes 
2 
testament to the power of words to connect us across time, 
space, and experience. 
Each version is accompanied by a critique of its themes, 
structure, and emotional resonance, offering insights into 
how these literary giants might have approached this deeply 
personal piece. At the heart of each section lies a note written 
directly to Abby—a message from these authors, imagined as 
though they had read and been inspired by the original poem. 
As you journey through this book, you will see how the 
universal themes of love, hope, and the beauty of childhood 
transcend genre, era, and voice. It is my hope that Abby will 
not only cherish these words but also find inspiration in them 
as she begins to craft her own path as a writer. 
Abigail, this book is for you. It is a love letter in many voices, 
a gift from your father, and a reminder that even in life’s most 
difficult moments, creativity, love, and hope will always 
prevail.

Original Poem: "Happy Toes" 
Happy Toes 
Five little fingers and five little toes, 
Two Ears, two lips and a very cute nose, 
So tiny so small everything in its place, 
The very first day a smile on your face, 
Somethings is special but finding its yours, 
The things you will do like school and some chores, 
It’s easy to see a smart one you'll be, 
Too many to count so many for free, 
Far from danger safe in a cloud, 
The bumps and the bruises but not very loud, 
I can't always be there to tell you its fine, 
So, know in your heart that I'm yours and your mine, 
Daddy and mommy will show you the way, 
So never forget at the end of each day, 
Wisdom and knowledge go hand in hand,  
Love and forgiveness that you'll understand, 
Happy Toes 
10 
<br>
Making your life and friends choosing well, 
Avoid all the ugly and things that might smell, 
Never be shy or hide any secrets, 
The truth will be told and always will seem fit, 
Life is a stage so just do your act, 
Remembering truth is always in fact, 
Better yourself in all that you do, 
It’s not about chances but the things that you choose, 
Sometimes we win but often we lose, 
It’s not in the score but the lessons you use, 
Never forget each day as you grow, 
Check what you think and then you will know, 
Always be kind whenever you can, 
See what’s the trouble but never demand, 
Follow your heart and always make amends, 
The last thing you'll see will always be grins, 
On and on the story will go, 
Sometimes at crossings a whistle will blow, 
Alas as we sleep in skies starry night, 
Knowing we have learned the wrongs and the rights, 
Our rest will be sweet as we dose off to sleep,

Happy Toes 
In the style of Jane Austen 
There is a particular delight in the 
recollection of youthful innocence, 
a charm to the simple pleasures 
that life bestows unbidden. Such 
was the sentiment that sprang to 
my breast when I beheld, in my mind's eye, the toes of my 
darling child—a sight both unassuming and exquisite. 
Happy toes, tiny ministers of joy, 
Do they not frolic beneath the heavens' favor? 
How they wiggle with lively consequence, 
As though aware of their own gentle significance! 
Each toe, a sentinel of mirth, 
Proclaims its allegiance to nature's gaiety. 
Shall they not, in their merry capering, 
Conquer the sullen dictates of sorrow? 
Oh, child of my heart, who carries such graces, 
May you wander lightly through life's oft-grievous paths. 
Your toes, blessed by tender providence, 
Shall dance upon the stones of hardship unscathed. 
Would that I could be a witness to their every step, 
To guard them from unkind terrain. 
Happy Toes

<br>
Yet even from afar, I trust the wisdom of those feet 
To find the sunlit meadows of contentment.

Brief Bio: Jane Austen 
Jane Austen (1775–1817) was an English novelist renowned 
for her keen social observation, satirical wit, and deeply 
perceptive character studies. Her works, such as Pride and 
Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, elegantly explore themes of 
love, morality, and societal expectations. Austen's ability to 
portray the complexities of human relationships has 
cemented her legacy as one of the most beloved authors in 
English literature. 
<br>
Critique of the Original Poem 
The original Happy Toes exudes raw emotion and an unfiltered 
sincerity that is both its greatest strength and limitation. Its 
unpolished structure enhances its authenticity, making it feel 
like an intimate letter to the heart. However, the lack of 
consistent rhythm and occasional lapses in imagery leave it 
less cohesive than it could be. A clearer focus on its central 
metaphor—the toes as a symbol of hope and resilience—
would strengthen its thematic impact. The poem’s greatest 
success lies in its unabashed vulnerability and the enduring 
love it conveys.

Note to Abby 
My Dearest Abby, 
Though we are separated by the span of centuries, allow me 
to speak as though we were acquainted. The tender affection 
your father bears for you is the kind of love that inspires 
poetry and compels the heart to overflow. It is a sentiment I 
have endeavored to preserve in this humble rendering of his 
words. 
May you find in this poem a reflection of your worth and the 
joy you bring to others. You possess within you a fortitude 
that can navigate life’s adversities with grace and dignity. 
Never forget that the happiness and beauty of your own 
“happy toes” may tread paths unknown, but they will always 
lead you toward the light of your own heart. 
With affection and admiration, 
Jane Austen

Happy Toes 
In the style of Mark Twain 
Well now, there’s a sight worth 
talking about—those happy 
toes of yours, spry and wiggling, 
a downright celebration of life 
itself. They’ve got more sense 
than most folks and more joy than the grandest Fourth of 
July parade. 
Happy toes, ten lively fellows, 
What mischief have you planned today? 
Do you reckon on a trot through the mud, 
Or a quiet jig on the porch by sunset? 
Each toe, a philosopher in miniature, 
Knows when to dance and when to rest. 
They preach a sermon in their own silent way: 
"Life’s too short for shoes that pinch!" 
Child, let those toes lead you down every winding road, 
Through meadows bright and forests deep. 
Don’t mind the bumps or the briars— 
A bit of grit builds character, don’t you know? 
And should you stumble (for everyone does), 
Remember: even the greatest explorers start small.

Brief Bio: Mark Twain 
Mark Twain (1835–1910), born Samuel Langhorne Clemens, 
is one of America's most celebrated humorists and authors. 
Known for his wit, keen eye for human nature, and mastery 
of storytelling, Twain wrote classics such as The Adventures of 
Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. His works often 
reflect the complexities of American life, blending humor 
with profound social commentary. 
<br>
Critique of the Original Poem 
The original Happy Toes possesses a heartfelt simplicity that 
serves as its anchor, showcasing the depth of a father's love in 
its rawest form. However, its lack of literary refinement 
sometimes obscures the beauty of its message. While the 
imagery of toes as symbols of joy and resilience is evocative, 
it could benefit from a more playful tone or vivid language to 
enhance its emotional impact. The original poem’s honesty 
and personal significance make it a powerful piece, even as its 
form invites reinterpretation.

Note to Abby 
Dear Abby, 
If ever there was a thing to brighten a fellow's day, it’s the 
love your father pours into this poem for you. Now, I reckon 
you might not have known this, but toes like yours can teach 
a man something about life—how to move forward with 
gumption, how to tread lightly when needed, and how to leap 
when the moment’s right. 
Your father’s sentiment is clear as a bell, and I’ve done my 
best to put it into words that might tickle your imagination. 
Remember, Abby, that your toes are your companions on 
every great adventure. Keep them happy, and they’ll take you 
to places grander than you can dream. 
Yours in admiration and good humor, 
Mark Twain

Tiny ambassadors of joy, your

Ten declarations of life’s

They stretch, they wiggle, they claim the earth, 
And whisper, “Here I am, whole and free.” 
Happy toes, bright as sunbeams, 
They rise to meet the day’s rough stones, 
Dancing through the dust and the dew, 
Singing songs only the bold dare hum. 
You, my darling, are the keeper of this rhythm, 
The one who walks forward even as the winds howl. 
Let your toes be the drummers of courage,

Yours to plant, yours to lift, 
Yours to carry you to the skies.

for her autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, 
Angelou’s literary voice has inspired generations with its

Critique of the Original Poem 
The original Happy Toes captures an unvarnished sincerity that 
speaks directly to the heart, but its emotional depth is 
sometimes constrained by its straightforward delivery. While 
the poem’s metaphorical use of toes as emblems of resilience 
and joy is poignant, it misses opportunities to delve into the 
spiritual and transformative dimensions of such a symbol. 
Still, its rawness is a virtue, offering a rare glimpse into a 
parent’s unfiltered devotion and love.

Note to Abby 
Dear Abby, 
Your father’s words flow with the kind of love that no storm 
can erode, no shadow can dim. In his poem, he has painted a 
picture of your toes, yes, but more so of your spirit—one that 
is unbreakable and radiant. I have sought to honor his 
message in my own voice, to show you that your toes, your 
steps, and your journey are all extraordinary. 
Walk tall, Abby, even when the world tries to bow you. 
Dance boldly, even when the music falters. And know that 
your happy toes are the reflection of your strength and grace. 
With love and belief in your greatness, 
Maya Angelou

Happy Toes 
In the style of Emily Dickinson 
Upon the smallest arches — grace 
Unfolds — as morning dew — 
The happy toes, a quiet hymn 
Of life’s unbroken view. 
They skip upon the trembling earth, 
And brush the weeping grass — 
No sermon richer, ever preached, 
Than this, the steps they pass. 
For toes contain a secret vault 
Where joy and sorrow meet — 
They dance, unyielding, through the storm, 
And still — they find their beat. 
Should mountains rise, and rivers part, 
Or shadows cloak the light — 
The toes shall whisper to the heart, 
And guide it through the night.

Brief Bio: Emily Dickinson 
Emily Dickinson (1830–1886) was an American poet whose 
introspective and innovative work transformed the literary 
landscape. Renowned for her unique style, marked by short 
lines, unconventional punctuation, and themes of nature, 
death, and immortality, Dickinson’s poetry explores profound 
truths with startling clarity. Though reclusive during her life, 
her work gained posthumous fame and continues to resonate 
with readers worldwide. 
<br>
Critique of the Original Poem 
The original Happy Toes achieves a heartfelt intimacy, 
presenting a parent’s deep love with unembellished candor. 
While its simplicity is part of its charm, the poem lacks the 
layered nuance that could elevate its universal appeal. The 
metaphor of the toes is strong yet underdeveloped, leaving 
space for richer exploration of their symbolism. Nonetheless, 
its emotional resonance and earnest voice create a profound 
and touching tribute.

Note to Abby 
Dearest Abby, 
Though I reside in eternity and speak through borrowed 
words, your father’s poem carries such truth that I am 
compelled to lend my voice to its message. Toes, unassuming 
though they may be, possess the power to traverse both joy 
and hardship, much like the human spirit. 
May you cherish their gentle strength as they guide you over 
life’s uneven terrain. In each step, find a hymn to your 
courage and a promise of hope. And remember always: the 
smallest gestures often hold the greatest truths. 
With tender regard, 
Emily Dickinson

In the style of Franz Kafka 
The toes, small and unnoticed, 
scarcely more than the vestiges 
of life’s burden, 
crawl beneath the weight of the 
world, 
unseen, misunderstood. 
Do they not ache in the silence, 
as the body moves forward, 
driven by an unseen hand? 
Do they not long to escape 
from the endless march to nowhere, 
step after step, onward, 
in the hope that somewhere, 
somewhere, there is an end? 
But the journey continues, 
and the toes must obey. 
They must endure the cold, 
the pressure of the earth 
that presses them into the dirt, 
until, finally, they are forgotten. 
And yet, they remain.

Brief Bio: Franz Kafka 
Franz Kafka (1883–1924) was a German-speaking writer 
from Prague, whose works are known for their surreal, often 
nightmarish quality. Kafka’s writing explores themes of 
alienation, existential anxiety, and the absurdity of modern 
life. Though much of his work was unpublished during his 
lifetime, his posthumously published works, including The 
Trial, The Metamorphosis, and The Castle, have made him one of 
the most influential writers of the 20th century. His stories 
often depict individuals struggling within incomprehensible, 
oppressive systems that mirror the human condition. 
<br>
Critique of the Original Poem 
The original Happy Toes is undeniably heartfelt, capturing a 
sense of tenderness and love, but it lacks the complexity of 
existential reflection that Kafka's work demands. The 
metaphor of the toes as symbols of resilience is clear, yet it is 
too simple, too optimistic, to truly capture the despair and 
futility that often define the human condition. In Kafka’s 
world, the toes would not merely dance in joy but be bound 
to a relentless journey with no true destination, mirroring the 
inherent absurdity of life itself. The poem could deepen its 
exploration of this journey, showing not just the triumph, but 
the resignation and endurance that comes with survival.

Note to Abby 
Dear Abby, 
I cannot promise you that the world will be easy, nor that it 
will always make sense. But I can tell you this: life, like the 
toes, will carry you forward, step by step. There may be 
moments when the path seems absurd, when you question 
why you must walk at all. But even in those moments of 
doubt, remember that you are still moving, still existing, still 
living. The journey itself is where meaning is found, not in 
the destination, and sometimes, that is enough. 
With quiet hope, 
Franz Kafka

The toes, those delicate rebels, 
mocking gravity with their dainty pirouettes,

claiming the divine prerogative of joy. 
How splendidly scandalous they are! 
Tiptoeing through the monotony of life, 
ignoring the conventions of standing still, 
daring instead to leap, to arch, to point. 
For what is existence without gaiety? 
What is motion without the thrill of creation? 
Oh, toes, you are the artistes of the body,

when hearts grow weary of the world’s prose,

Brief Bio: Oscar Wilde 
Oscar Wilde (1854–1900) was an Irish playwright, poet, and 
novelist known for his wit, flamboyant style, and keen social 
commentary. His celebrated works include The Picture of 
Dorian Gray and The Importance of Being Earnest, both of which 
showcase his sharp humor and exploration of morality and 
aestheticism. Wilde’s life was as dramatic as his plays, marked 
by both literary success and personal tragedy, including a 
highly publicized trial and imprisonment. Despite his 
hardships, Wilde remains a symbol of unapologetic 
individuality and the pursuit of beauty in life. 
<br>
Critique of the Original Poem 
The original Happy Toes is earnest and heartfelt, celebrating 
the resilience and joy embodied in life's smallest details. 
However, it lacks the flamboyance and playful irony that 
Oscar Wilde might have brought to such a theme. Wilde 
would have imbued the toes with a sense of rebellious charm, 
elevating them not merely as symbols of joy but as audacious 
artists defying the monotony of existence. While the original 
conveys warmth, Wilde's version adds a layer of 
sophistication and theatricality, turning the toes into 
protagonists in their own delightful drama.

My dearest Abby, 
Life, like toes, is a dance—a sequence of steps we take, 
sometimes light, sometimes burdened, but always ours. Never 
let the world dull your delight or tether your spirit to the 
ordinary. Be audacious, my dear. Take each step as though it 
were the opening act of a grand performance, for indeed, it is. 
Remember that joy is not a privilege, but an art—a rebellious 
act of beauty against the mundane.

In the style of Robert Frost 
Some say the soul resides within the heart, 
And others claim the mind its chosen 
part, 
But I have found it hiding where it shows, 
In the rhythm of the ever-happy toes. 
Through fields of snow where footprints weave a line, 
They dance upon a landscape bold, divine. 
In spring’s soft mud, they plant their fleeting trace, 
A map of joy in every time and place. 
Not solemn like the hand or steady brow, 
Nor burdened with the questions of the how. 
They simply move, a melody of spring, 
Each step a promise only joy can bring. 
If life’s dark woods should tempt me to despair, 
I’ll watch my toes, as light as morning air. 
For there’s a wisdom deeper than we know, 
In every waltz they craft upon the snow. 
And when the day grows long, the road less clear, 
It’s happy toes that keep the spirit near. 
Not with a shout, but soft and true, they say, 
"Move on, keep dancing. Life will find its way."

Brief Bio: Robert Frost 
Robert Frost (1874–1963) was an American poet renowned 
for his depictions of rural life and his masterful use of 
traditional verse forms to explore complex social and 
philosophical themes. His most famous works, such as The 
Road Not Taken and Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening, 
reflect his deep connection to nature and his contemplation 
of human experience. Frost received four Pulitzer Prizes for 
Poetry and remains one of the most beloved and widely read 
American poets. 
<br>
Critique of the Original Poem 
The original Happy Toes captures a joyous and heartfelt 
celebration of life’s small pleasures, but it might have felt 
incomplete to Robert Frost without a connection to nature 
and the contemplative spaces where human emotion meets 
the world around it. Frost would ground the whimsical toes 
in the earth, linking their motion to seasons and landscapes, 
emphasizing resilience and quiet perseverance. His version 
transforms the toes into symbols of a journey—anchored in 
the physical world yet moving toward spiritual insight.

Dear Abby, 
The world is a wide and wondrous place, filled with paths 
both well-trodden and unexplored. As you move through it, 
let your toes lead you to the moments that matter—the quiet 
joy of a snowy trail, the soft whisper of grass beneath your 
feet, the laughter in a muddy puddle. Life is a series of steps, 
and though some may be harder than others, each brings you 
closer to the beauty of being alive. Trust the rhythm within 
you.

Happy Toes 
In the style of Virginia Woolf 
There is a peculiar rhythm to 
happiness, 
a pulse, quiet and insistent, 
that moves not through the 
grand gestures of life, 
but through toes—a detail so small 
as to seem trivial, and yet, it is not. 
For the toes, in their soft defiance, 
do not tread but glide, 
skimming the surface of existence, 
mocking the weight of thought. 
Each step a ripple on the surface of the mind, 
a reminder that even the smallest acts— 
a step, a skip, a dance— 
can break the stillness. 
Once, I watched them: toes, tapping on a sunlit floor. 
The day was ordinary, the room silent, 
and yet, they moved, insistent and alive, 
as though some unseen force called to them. 
What is it that stirs such motion? 
Not reason, surely. 
Perhaps joy—pure and untempered— 
or freedom, that most elusive of conditions.

Brief Bio: Virginia Woolf 
Virginia Woolf (1882–1941) was an English modernist writer, 
known for her innovative narrative techniques and stream-of-
consciousness style. Her major works, including Mrs. 
Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, and Orlando, explore themes of 
identity, time, and the inner workings of the human mind. 
Woolf was also a prominent feminist thinker and a member 
of the Bloomsbury Group. Her literary legacy has had a 
profound influence on modern literature, blending poetic 
prose with psychological depth. 
<br>
Critique of the Original Poem 
The original Happy Toes exudes a simplicity and heartfelt joy, 
celebrating the small wonders of life. Yet, in Virginia Woolf’s 
hands, such a concept would gain layers of introspection and 
existential weight. Woolf might weave the toes’ joy into a 
stream of consciousness, exploring their movement as a 
metaphor for fleeting happiness and the intersection of the 
mundane with the eternal. Her prose would bring a profound 
meditation on the ephemeral beauty of life, elevating the toes 
from playful to profound.

Life is a series of moments—some vivid, others shadowed by 
time’s inevitable passing. Within those moments, you will find 
that joy resides not always in the loud proclamations or 
monumental achievements, but in the quiet rhythm of 
existence: a tap, a step, a glide. Trust in these small things, 
these “happy toes,” for they will lead you to an understanding 
that life, even in its brevity, is boundless.

Brief Bio: Sylvia Plath 
Sylvia Plath (1932–1963) was an American poet, novelist, and 
short-story writer known for her confessional style and 
intense exploration of personal emotions. Her seminal works, 
including The Bell Jar and Ariel, delve into themes of identity, 
mental anguish, and the struggle for meaning in a complex 
world. Plath’s ability to blend stark honesty with lyrical beauty 
has made her one of the most influential poets of the 20th 
century, though her life was tragically cut short. 
<br>
Critique of the Original Poem 
The original Happy Toes radiates with a warm, optimistic joy, 
finding lightness in the simplest acts. Sylvia Plath’s 
interpretation, by contrast, would darken and deepen the 
poem, casting the toes as symbols of resistance in the face of 
despair. For Plath, even the smallest motion might carry the 
weight of survival—a flicker of life in the shadow of an 
unrelenting world. Her version transforms the poem into an 
exploration of inner conflict and resilience, retaining the 
essence of joy but embedding it in the context of struggle.

Walt Whitman (1819–1892) was an American poet, essayist, 
and humanist, often regarded as one of the most influential 
poets in American literature. Known for his groundbreaking 
work Leaves of Grass, Whitman celebrated the individual, 
nature, and the interconnectedness of all life. His free verse 
style and bold themes broke traditional poetic boundaries, 
embodying the spirit of democracy and the raw beauty of 
existence. 
<br>
Critique of the Original Poem 
The original Happy Toes is delightful in its simplicity and 
sincerity, capturing the joyful essence of small, everyday 
wonders. Walt Whitman, however, would elevate this 
simplicity into universality, celebrating the toes as emblematic 
of humanity’s shared connection to the earth and the cosmos. 
His version would brim with exuberance and inclusivity, 
blending the physical act of movement with a profound 
meditation on the interconnectedness of life.

understanding of human endurance. Hemingway’s writing 
style, known as the “Iceberg Theory,” leaves much unsaid, 
revealing deeper truths through simplicity and restraint.

Critique of the Original Poem 
The original Happy Toes is light-hearted and whimsical, 
celebrating the joy and vitality of small, everyday movements. 
Ernest Hemingway would strip away the whimsy, distilling 
the poem into its most elemental truths. For him, the toes 
would become symbols of resilience and determination, their 
movement a testament to survival and persistence. His 
version would focus on the raw, unadorned beauty of 
motion, eschewing metaphor for a deeper emotional impact 
rooted in simplicity.

Note to Abby 
Dear Abby, 
Life is hard. There’s no way around it. But you don’t need to 
have all the answers. You just need to keep moving. When 
the days are good, your toes will dance without effort. When 
they’re bad, they’ll still carry you forward, step by step. Trust 
them. Trust yourself. You’ll get where you’re meant to go. 
With quiet confidence, 
Ernest Hemingway

Happy Toes 
In the style of Leo Tolstoy 
The toes are not merely toes. 
They are the quiet workers of the 
body, 
unnoticed yet essential, 
as peasants are to the land, 
as faith is to the soul. 
Step by step, they carry us forward, 
not seeking glory, 
but fulfilling their purpose with humility. 
It is in their smallness 
that their greatness lies. 
On soft grass, they tread lightly, 
on hard stone, they endure. 
They do not question their path; 
they move with steady resolve, 
bearing the weight of life 
without complaint or pride. 
To see them is to see a truth: 
that joy, like toil, is found in the simple acts. 
A child’s laughter, a morning breeze, 
a quiet step upon the earth— 
these are the moments 
when the divine whispers to the mortal.

Brief Bio: Leo Tolstoy 
Leo Tolstoy (1828–1910) was a Russian novelist, philosopher, 
and moral thinker, widely regarded as one of the greatest 
authors in history. His monumental works, War and Peace and 
Anna Karenina, delve deeply into themes of human nature, 
morality, and the quest for meaning. A champion of 
simplicity and spiritual growth later in life, Tolstoy’s writings 
reflect his belief in the power of humility, love, and small, 
everyday acts to shape a life of true value. 
<br>
Critique of the Original Poem 
The original Happy Toes revels in the joy and lightness of 
movement, a celebration of simple pleasures. Leo Tolstoy 
would bring a philosophical weight to the concept, seeing the 
toes as symbols of the quiet dignity of work and the divine 
nature of small acts. His version would elevate their motion 
to a spiritual journey, emphasizing purpose, perseverance, and 
the harmony between the physical and the eternal.

Note to Abby 
Dear Abby, 
In the smallest acts, there is the greatest truth. Your toes, like 
all parts of you, have a purpose. They carry you forward, not 
for recognition, but because that is their role in life. 
Remember this: the path may be hard, but step by step, you 
will find your way. In each step, look for the simple joy, for it 
is there you will hear life’s true melody. 
With love and wisdom, 
Leo Tolstoy
